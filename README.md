# Simon Says Memory Game Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Simon Says Memory Game project! This interactive game is designed to challenge and enhance your memory skills while providing an engaging gaming experience. The game utilizes four push buttons representing colors: red, blue, green, and yellow. The system displays a random color sequence, and your goal is to replicate the sequence correctly. With each successful input, the system adds a new color to the sequence, increasing the difficulty.

## Features

- **Sequential Challenges:** As you progress, the game introduces a new color to the sequence, increasing the difficulty and testing your memory skills.
- **Seven-Segment Display:** The score is prominently displayed on the seven-segment display of the FPGA, allowing you to easily track your performance.
- **Visual Representation:** The display visually represents the color sequence, making it easier for players to replicate the pattern accurately.
